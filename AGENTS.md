# Working on this project

A Flix project that carries its own compiler. `./flixw` downloads the exact
`flix.jar` pinned in `.flixw/lock.toml`, verifies it against a committed
SHA-256, and runs it. Nothing needs installing but a JDK — 21 or newer.

## Commands

Run everything through the wrapper: `flix` is not expected to be on `PATH`, and
a `flix` that is may be a different version than this project pins. On Windows
use `.\flixw.cmd` wherever these say `./flixw`.

- `./flixw check` — type-check without generating code; the fast feedback loop
- `./flixw test` — run every `@Test` function under `test/`
- `./flixw run` — run `main`
- `./flixw build` — compile to `build/class`
- `./flixw format` — reformat sources in place; the pinned compiler has no
  check-only mode, so CI does not gate on formatting
- `./flixw doc` — write API documentation for the standard library and this
  project to `build/doc/`
- `./flixw metrics report --format md` — review-ready code metrics and findings
- `./flixw metrics report --format json --view findings --severity warning` —
  compact, actionable input for an agent; use `--view summary` for a quick
  project snapshot

Run metrics after tests and before every commit. Fix genuine findings or document
why they are intentional; do not mechanically optimize rankings or contextual
handler/effect facts, which are measurements rather than policy. The exact plugin
version and digest are declared in `.flixw/lock.toml`. Installation is still
per-machine; if it is missing, `./flixw metrics` prints the pinned install command.

The wrapper adds verbs of its own, ahead of the compiler's:

- `./flixw validate` — the wrapper's own consistency checks, for CI
- `./flixw doctor` — those checks plus the full picture, for bug reports (`--fix` to repair)
- `./flixw pin <version>` — move to another compiler and rewrite the lock
- `./flixw info` — view project, compiler, Java, and cache state
- `./flixw local add <path>` / `./flixw local <verb>` — override declared GitHub dependencies with local checkouts for testing and development
- `./flixw examples <verb> <name>` — run, check, build, or test an isolated package in `examples/<name>`

## Layout

- `src/` — sources; `src/Main.flix` holds `main`
- `test/` — `@Test` functions
- `flix.toml` — package metadata, dependencies, and the *lowest* Flix version
  this project accepts
- `.flixw/lock.toml` — the exact compiler and its digest. `flix.toml` states a
  floor; this states the pin. Both are committed, and `validate` fails when
  they disagree
- `flixw`, `flixw.cmd`, `.flixw/flixw.java` — the wrapper itself. Generated;
  change it with `./flixw wrapper --upgrade`, never by hand
- `.github/workflows/` — `build-and-test.yaml` on three platforms,
  `update-flix.yaml` weekly, `docs.yaml` for the API documentation. All three
  drive the wrapper; none of them install Flix
- `build/`, `artifact/`, `lib/` — generated; do not edit and do not commit

`CLAUDE.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` both point at this file
rather than repeating it, so that each tool finds the same instructions under
the name it looks for.

## Test-driven development (TDD)

Always follow a test-driven development workflow (Red-Green-Refactor):

1. **Red**: Write a failing test under `test/` first before adding or modifying code in `src/`. Run `./flixw test` to confirm it fails for the expected reason.
2. **Green**: Write the minimal implementation in `src/` to make the test pass. Run `./flixw test` to confirm it passes.
3. **Refactor**: Clean up the design while keeping all tests passing. Run
   `./flixw format` and `./flixw metrics report --format md` before committing.

Never write production code without a failing test first. Every bug fix must begin with a test reproducing the bug.

## Writing Flix

Your training data is probably older than this compiler. Before writing Flix,
read the official [Flix guidance for LLMs](https://doc.flix.dev/for-llms.html)
and prefer the current book over research papers, talks, and old examples. Use
[api.flix.dev](https://api.flix.dev) for standard-library modules, types,
functions, and signatures. Do not unpack, decompile, or grep `flix.jar` to guess
at APIs. `./flixw doc` remains useful for this project's generated API pages.

The mistakes that show up most often:

- `def main(): Unit \ IO = ...` — arguments come from `Env.getArgs()`, not from
  parameters
- use built-in `Util.Json`, not the third-party `flix-json` package
- effects are written with `\`, not `&`
- effect operations are called like ordinary functions; there is no `do` keyword
- handlers are `run { ... } with handler E { ... }`; chain them rather than
  nesting `run`
- prefer standard-library effects and handle them near `main`; do not simulate
  effects with callback-based CPS
- annotations are uppercase: `@Test`, `@Lazy`, `@Parallel`, `@MustUse`
- companion enums, structs, effects, and traits go first inside their module
- Datalog `inject` names predicate arity (`Edge/2`); predicate symbols are
  inferred, so do not write old `rel` or `lat` declarations
- Java types need a top-level `import`; Java interop carries `IO`, and `unsafe`
  is only for calls known to be pure

Prefer effects and handlers to callbacks or hand-written CPS, and standard
library effects to Java interop.

## Naming modules

A module has one declaration site in the whole program, dependencies included,
so never take a common top-level name.

- one root namespace per package, named after it: `flix-json` roots at `Json`
- directories mirror module paths: `Json.FromJson` in `src/Json/FromJson.flix`
- two or three levels; `Internal` for what is not API
- name a module for what is done there: `Json.Parse` holds `parse`
- spell names out; tests flat, one `TestX` per subject
- a library deletes `src/Main.flix`: one `main` per program, so a package that
  ships one cannot be depended on
