# Working on this project

A Flix project that carries its own compiler. `./flixw` downloads the exact
`flix.jar` pinned in `.flixw/lock.toml`, verifies it against a committed
SHA-256, and runs it. Nothing needs installing but a JDK — 21 or newer.

## Commands

Run everything through the wrapper: `flix` is not expected to be on `PATH`, and
a `flix` that is may be a different version than this project pins. On Windows
use `.\flixw.cmd` wherever these say `./flixw`.

- `./flixw check` — type-check without generating code; the fast feedback loop
- `./flixw test` — run every `@Test` function under `test/`
- `./flixw run` — run `main`
- `./flixw build` — compile to `build/class`
- `./flixw format` — reformat sources in place; the pinned compiler has no
  check-only mode, so CI does not gate on formatting
- `./flixw doc` — write API documentation for the standard library and this
  project to `build/doc/`

The wrapper adds verbs of its own, ahead of the compiler's:

- `./flixw validate` — the wrapper's own consistency checks, for CI
- `./flixw doctor` — those checks plus the full picture, for bug reports
- `./flixw pin <version>` — move to another compiler and rewrite the lock

## Layout

- `src/` — sources; `src/Main.flix` holds `main`
- `test/` — `@Test` functions
- `flix.toml` — package metadata, dependencies, and the *lowest* Flix version
  this project accepts
- `.flixw/lock.toml` — the exact compiler and its digest. `flix.toml` states a
  floor; this states the pin. Both are committed, and `validate` fails when
  they disagree
- `flixw`, `flixw.cmd`, `.flixw/flixw.java` — the wrapper itself. Generated;
  change it with `./flixw wrapper --upgrade`, never by hand
- `.github/workflows/` — `build-and-test.yaml` on three platforms,
  `update-flix.yaml` weekly, `docs.yaml` for the API documentation. All three
  drive the wrapper; none of them install Flix
- `build/`, `artifact/`, `lib/` — generated; do not edit and do not commit

`CLAUDE.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` both point at this file
rather than repeating it, so that each tool finds the same instructions under
the name it looks for.

## Writing Flix

Your training data is probably older than this compiler. Read
<https://doc.flix.dev/for-llms.html> before writing Flix: it lists what changed.
For the standard library use <https://api.flix.dev>, or run `./flixw doc` and
read `build/doc/`, which matches this project's compiler exactly.

The mistakes that show up most often:

- `def main(): Unit \ IO = ...` — arguments come from `Env.getArgs()`, not from
  parameters
- effects are written with `\`, not `&`
- effect operations are called like ordinary functions; there is no `do` keyword
- handlers are `run { ... } with handler E { ... }`; chain them rather than
  nesting `run`
- annotations are uppercase: `@Test`, `@Lazy`, `@Parallel`, `@MustUse`
- Java types need a top-level `import`, and all Java interop carries `IO`

Prefer effects and handlers to callbacks or hand-written CPS, and standard
library effects to Java interop.
