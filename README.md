A GitHub template for starting a [Flix](https://flix.dev) project, and a
worked example of [`flixw`](https://github.com/wstein/flixw) — a
repository-local bootstrap that fetches the compiler the project pins instead
of relying on whatever `flix` happens to be installed.

## Quick start

Click **Use this template**, clone your copy, and run it:

```sh
./flixw run          # .\flixw.cmd run on Windows
```

The only prerequisite is a JDK, Java 21 or newer. You do not need Flix
installed: the first command downloads `flix.jar` for the version pinned in
`.flixw/lock.toml`, checks it against the SHA-256 committed alongside it, caches
it outside the repository, and runs it. Later commands reuse the cache.

```sh
./flixw check        # type-check; the fast feedback loop
./flixw test         # run every @Test function under test/
./flixw format       # reformat sources in place
./flixw validate     # the wrapper's own consistency checks; what CI runs first
./flixw doctor       # validate, plus the full picture, for bug reports
```

`flix.toml` states a *floor* and `.flixw/lock.toml` states the *pin*. They are
allowed to differ — any pin at or above the floor satisfies it — but
`./flixw validate` fails when the pin does not, so the two cannot drift apart
unnoticed.

## What the wrapper is and is not

`flixw` never patches, forks or links against the Flix compiler. It fetches the
stock `flix.jar` by URL, verifies the digest before every use, and runs it as an
opaque process. Moving to another compiler is `./flixw pin <version>`, which
rewrites the lock; updating the wrapper itself is
`./flixw wrapper --upgrade`.

Two things are worth knowing before you adopt it. `flixw` is upstream-described
as experimental, and it is code your project executes on every build — which is
why it is committed in full and pinned by version and digest rather than curled
at run time. Read `.flixw/flixw.java` if that matters to you; it is deliberately
one file.

## Continuous integration

`.github/workflows/build-and-test.yaml` runs `validate`, `check` and `test`
through the wrapper on Linux, macOS and Windows — the Windows leg exercises
`flixw.cmd`, the others the POSIX shim. It installs a JDK and nothing else,
which is the same starting position a new contributor is in. The compiler is
restored from the runner cache, keyed on `.flixw/lock.toml`, and its digest is
re-verified whether it came from the cache or the network. Actions are pinned to
commit digests and kept current by Dependabot.

There is no formatting gate: the pinned compiler's `format` has no check-only
mode, so run `./flixw format` before you commit.

`.github/workflows/update-flix.yaml` runs weekly. Dependabot has no ecosystem
for a compiler pinned by URL and digest, so this is its counterpart: it resolves
the newest `flix/flix` release, re-pins, runs `validate`, `check` and `test`,
and opens a pull request if all three pass. It never pushes to the default
branch — the digest in a re-pinned lock is computed by the runner, and that is
the thing worth reading before merging.

`.github/workflows/docs.yaml` runs `./flixw doc` on every push to `main` and
publishes this project's own pages to GitHub Pages — for this repository, at
<https://wstein.github.io/flix-template/>.

`flix doc` renders the whole standard library alongside the project and has no
option to narrow that: `--Xlib` decides what is *compiled*, and without the
library nothing compiles at all. Its `index.html` is the stdlib's `Prelude`
page. So the workflow picks out the project's pages afterwards — by which ones
carry a source link into the workspace, which no library page does — writes its
own landing page listing them, and refuses to publish at all if that finds
nothing. A link check then fails the build if anything published points at a
page that was not.

One upstream quirk is worked around there too. `flix doc` builds each `Source`
link by appending the documented file's path to the standard library's own base
URL on `flix/flix`, which for this project's files yields a 404 with the build
machine's absolute path inside it. The workflow rewrites those into permalinks
at the published commit, and fails if any filesystem path survives.

Pages has to be enabled once, under **Settings → Pages** with source
**GitHub Actions**: the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot create a Pages site even
with `pages: write`. Until it is, the documentation is still built and the run
warns rather than failing, so a fresh copy of this template does not start red.

## After you template this

1. `flix.toml` — set `name`, `description`, `version` and `authors`. The package
   name is yours to choose; nothing requires it to match the repository name.
2. `LICENSE` — replace the copyright line, or the whole license.
3. `src/` and `test/` — replace the greeting with your own code.
4. This README — the badge URLs and the documentation link. Until you point
   them at your own repository they report this one's state, not yours. CI
   fails on the first push until you do, and names every URL still pointing
   here.
5. **Settings → Pages**, source **GitHub Actions**, if you want the published
   documentation. Skip it and `docs.yaml` just warns.

The Flix and `flixw` badges read `.flixw/lock.toml` directly, so re-pinning with
`./flixw pin <version>` updates them without touching this file.
